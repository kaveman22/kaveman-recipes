# Sticky Mango Jerk Chicken Wings

These delicious sticky mango jerk chicken wings combine the heat of Jamaican jerk seasoning with the sweet tropical flavor of mango for an irresistible appetizer or main dish.

## Ingredients

### For the Wings
- 2 lbs chicken wings, patted dry
- 2 tbsp jerk seasoning
- 1 tsp salt (or to taste)
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

### For the Sticky Mango Sauce
- 1 ripe mango, peeled and diced
- 3 tbsp honey
- 1/2 scotch bonnet pepper, deseeded and finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch piece ginger, grated
- Juice of 1 lime
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 green onions, sliced (plus extra for garnish)
- 1/4 cup water

## Directions

### Step 1: Prepare the Wings
- Preheat oven to 400째F (200째C)
- In a large bowl, toss the chicken wings with jerk seasoning, salt, pepper, and oil until evenly coated
- Arrange wings on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, making sure they're not touching
- Bake for 25-30 minutes until crispy and cooked through, turning halfway

### Step 2: Make the Mango Sauce
- While the wings are baking, add diced mango to a blender or food processor and puree until smooth
- In a saucepan over medium heat, combine mango puree, honey, scotch bonnet, garlic, ginger, lime juice, brown sugar, and soy sauce
- Bring to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes until thickened, stirring occasionally
- Add water if the sauce becomes too thick
- Stir in sliced green onions during the last minute of cooking

### Step 3: Glaze the Wings
- When wings are done, remove from oven and increase temperature to 425째F (220째C)
- Brush wings generously with the mango sauce, reserving some for serving
- Return to oven for 5-7 minutes until the glaze is sticky and caramelized

### Step 4: Serve
- Transfer wings to a serving platter
- Drizzle with remaining sauce
- Garnish with additional sliced green onions
- Serve hot with extra sauce on the side for dipping
