- 8 cloves garlic, minced
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 cup yogurt
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)
- 1 tsp salt

### Step 4: Assemble the Dish
- Place the hollowed pomegranate half on a serving platter
- Arrange the sliced chicken shawarma on and around the pomegranate
- Drizzle with pomegranate molasses
- Sprinkle with fresh herbs and additional pomegranate seeds
- Add toasted pine nuts if using
