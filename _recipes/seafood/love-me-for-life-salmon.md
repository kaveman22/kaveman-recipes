This indulgent salmon dish features perfectly seared fillets in a rich, creamy garlic herb sauce with a Cajun kick. It's a restaurant-quality meal that's surprisingly easy to make at home.

## Ingredients

- 4 salmon fillets (about 6 oz each)
- 2 tbsp Cajun seasoning
- 1 tsp salt (adjust based on your Cajun seasoning)
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

## Directions

### Step 1: Prepare the Salmon

- Cook for 4-5 minutes until skin is crispy
- Flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes until salmon is almost cooked through

- Add minced garlic and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant
- Pour in heavy cream and chicken broth, stirring to combine
- Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 3-4 minutes until slightly thickened
- Stir in Parmesan cheese until melted and smooth

### Step 4: Add Vegetables and Herbs
- Add spinach and cherry tomatoes to the sauce
- Cook for 2 minutes until spinach is wilted and tomatoes begin to soften
- Stir in fresh herbs and lemon juice
- Season with salt and pepper to taste

### Step 5: Finish the Dish
- Return salmon to the skillet, nestling it into the sauce
- Spoon sauce over the salmon
- Cover and simmer for 2-3 minutes until salmon is fully cooked and heated through
- Garnish with additional fresh herbs and lemon slices

### Step 6: Serve
- Serve immediately with the sauce spooned over the salmon
- Pairs well with rice, pasta, or crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce
